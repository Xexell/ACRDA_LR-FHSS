# Asynchronous Contention Resolution-Aided ALOHA in LR-FHSS Networks

This repository reproduces the simulations and figures of the following article:

J. M. S. Santâ€™Ana, O. S. Neto, A. Hoeller, J. L. Rebelatto, R. D. Souza and H. Alves, "[Asynchronous Contention Resolution-Aided ALOHA in LR-FHSS Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403992)," in IEEE Internet of Things Journal, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2024.3355709.

The simulations are carried using the [LR-FHSS-Sim](https://github.com/Xexell/LR-FHSS-sim) which is a on-going project work.

Note that the simulation settings are exactly what was used in the paper. They were run on dedicated servers with high computational power. To test it on an usual computer/laptop, it is reccomended to decrease the number of loop iterations and to adjust the number of parallel cores in the code. The .data files inside folder paper_sketches contain the data results from the extensive simulations.

Plots were made with the [SciencePlots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots) library.
